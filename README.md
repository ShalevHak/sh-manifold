- shalev directory contains:
  - main.cpp - The main program. Using ExportMesh for export.
  - cmakelists.txt - The CMake file for building the necessary items for compiling.
  - exportToSTL.cpp - A program for creating a manifold and exporting in an unconventional way directly to STL.
- Build:
  - Build the Maniold c++ library from https://github.com/elalish/manifold in the 'external' directory by following these steps:
    - cd external
    - git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/elalish/manifold.git
    - cd manifold
    - mkdir build
    - cd build
    - cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON .. && make
  - Build the project again in shalev directory:
    - cd shalev
    - mkdir build
    - cd build
    - cmake ..
    - make
  - To run the program:
    - ./my_program
    - In the build directory result.glb is the file that will contain the 3D model
